# Revise - DSA

- Revise was designed and developed to address 2 major real-world challenges. By generating questions from 10+ topics on the same page.

- Revise helps in the periodic revision of DSA problems. This project currently has 200+ live users.

- I used leetcode questions data to store, and performed multiple queries to filter the most liked and appropriatequestions, so the end user won't waste time on disliked questions.

## Features

- Google Account Authentication

- On a single page, questions from all topics are grouped.
